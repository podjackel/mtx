# MTX Framework

Just a funny porting of the real Metasploit Framework written in GreyScript language for Grey Hack game and as Metasploit... **_MTX Framework is Open Source!_**

Author: tuonux \<tuonux0@gmail.com\>

## Play on Grey Hack like a pseudo-real hacker!

MTX Framework offer the possibility to get you in a pseudo-real hacker experience like the famous Metasploit command line based interface!

## Scan, Discover, Exploit and more!

You have a lot o commands to perform and hack your target in the game!

## See the MTX Framework in action:

### Build the framework first

Just copy and paste the **mtx.src** code in **CodeEditor.exe** and build it with name **mtx**

### Launch the mtx framework and wait the loading

### Do you want to upgrade your exploits db?

    Try to use the "discover" command!

## MTX Framework Filesystem storage

Every modules are stored under the folder \<mtx_binary_path\>/mtxframework/exploits

There are different modules type that corrispond to own folders

Example:

    shell          Exploit that attempt to obtain a shell session
    computer       Exploit that attempt to obtain a computer session
    file           Exploit that attempt to obtain a file session
    lanswitcher    Exploit that attempt to route a router and gain a shell on a internal target IP machine
    passwchanger   Exploit that attempt to change a non-root user password with a new provided password
    fwshutdown     Exploit that attempt to shutdown a router firewall
    generic        Exploit that are not tested 100% or that need more requirements in order to be used

For example, shell exploits for ssh service are stored in this path

    \<mtx_binary_path\>/mtxframework/exploits/shell/ssh/<esploit_name>.src

## Write your own exploit compatible with framework!

Yes, **you read right**!

With MTX you have the possibility to **write your own exploit in GreyScript** exatly like Metasploit permit to do!

#### The magic of the <b>get_custom_object.MTXExploit</b>:

This object is the core of the entire framework and exploits comunication!

In this example you can see how you can write an exploit!

```
// This module requires MTX Framework:     https://github.com/tuonux/mtx
// Current source:              		   https://github.com/tuonux/mtx

MTXExploit = get_custom_object.MTXExploit
MTXExploit.name  = "<enter the exploit name>"
MTXExploit.description = "<enter the exploit description>"
MTXExploit.author = "<enter the exploit author>"
MTXExploit.rank = "<enter a rank like Low|Average|Normal|Good|Great|Excellent>"
MTXExploit.privileged = "<enter 1|0 if your exploit get elevate privileges>"
MTXExploit.disclosure_date = "<enter the disclosure date>"
MTXExploit.options["<enter the option 1>"] = {"required": <is required? 1|0>, "default": "<default value>", "description": "<option description>"}
MTXExploit.options["<enter the option 2>"] = {"required": <is required? 1|0>, "default": "<default value>", "description": "<option description>"}
MTXExploit.options["<enter the option 3>"] = {"required": <is required? 1|0>, "default": "<default value>", "description": "<option description>"}

// Every exploit need a check funtion in order to declare if the target is vulnerable or not
// Mabybe a check on the library and the library version can help!
// The options Map contains the value of the options set by the user.
MTXExploit.check = function(options)
    target          = options.RHOST
    port            = options.RPORT.to_int
    argument        = options.RLANIP
    library_name    = "kernel_router.so"
    library_version = "1.0.5"
    address         = "0x4A033B44"
    variable        = "mored_"
    print_info("Attempt to connect on remote host...", target+":"+port)
    net = metaxploit.net_use(target, port)
    if not net then return print_error("Unable to connect to remote host", target+":"+port)
    print_good("Succesfully connected!", target+":"+port)
    if net.dump_lib.lib_name != library_name or net.dump_lib.version.to_int > library_version.to_int then return print_error("Different library. Required: kernel_router.so <= 1.0.5 ", target+":"+port)
    return true
end function

// This is the run() function to see your exploit in action and perform overflows and other commands that you need!
// The register_session(overflow_result) make a new sessions registered to the MTX Framework
// The options Map contains the value of the options set by the user.
MTXExploit.run = function(options)
    target          = options.RHOST
    port            = options.RPORT.to_int
    argument        = options.RLANIP
    library_name    = "kernel_router.so"
    library_version = "1.0.5"
    address         = "0x4A033B44"
    variable        = "mored_"
    print_info("Attempt to connect on remote host...", target+":"+port)
    net = metaxploit.net_use(target, port)
    if not net then return print_error("Unable to connect to remote host", target+":"+port)
    print_good("Succesfully connected!", target+":"+port)
    if net.dump_lib.lib_name != library_name or net.dump_lib.version.to_int > library_version.to_int then return print_error("Different library. Required: kernel_router.so <= 1.0.5 ", target+":"+port)
    print_good("Library check: OK")
    print_info("Attempt to oveflow the target library", target+":"+port)
    overflow_result = net.dump_lib.overflow(address, variable, argument)
    if not overflow_result then return print_error("Unable to perform an overflow to the target library. Try to check the requirements")
    register_session(overflow_result)
    return true
end function

```

It's a good pratice store your exploits under "custom" directory like example:

    \<mtx_binary_path\>/mtxframework/exploits/custom/<my_exploit_name>.src

After created a custom exploit, you need to use "reload" command if you have mtx running.

Click to see a tutorial about exploit writing for MTX Framework

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/KoSjqsYChvE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoSjqsYChvE "GREY HACK - MTX FRAMEWORK: WRITE YOUR FIRST EXPLOIT")

## Post exploitation: Payloads!

After that an exploit works successfully, we want to perform custom actions on it, maybe we want to download a file or if our mission need to make machine unreachable, we want to do it automatically.

Payloads make your post exploitation life easy!

This is an exploit example

#### The magic of the <b>get_custom_object.MTXPayload</b>:

This object is the core of the entire framework and payloads comunication!

```
// This module requires MTX Framework:     https://github.com/tuonux/mtx
// Current source:              		   https://github.com/tuonux/mtx

MTXPayload                   = get_custom_object.MTXPayload
MTXPayload.name              = "<enter the payload name>"
MTXPayload.description       = "<enter the payload description>"
MTXPayload.author            = "<enter the payload author>"
MTXPayload.options["STRING"] = {"required": 1, "default": "world", "description": "The string after hello"}

// This is the run() function that run post exploitation
// remote_object: The object that return after post exploitation <shell|computer|file>
// local_shell:   Your computer get_shell object
// options:       Options setted with "set <option> <value>" command
MTXPayload.run = function(remote_object, local_shell, options)
    object_type = typeof(remote_object)
    if object_type != "shell" then return print_error("This payload works with shell sessions only")
    print_good("Hello " + options["STRING"] + " i'm a remote shell and my ip is: " + remote_object.host_computer.public_ip)
end function

```

You can store your payload under:

    \<mtx_binary_path\>/mtxframework/payloads/<my_payload_name>.src

After created a custom payload, you need to use "reload" command if you have mtx running.

### Just keep in mind:

There are several function that you can use in your exploit or payloads code that extends MTX Framework.

    metaxploit                               The metaxploit class is alredy included. You don't need to include again.
    crypto                                   The crypto class is alredy included. You don't need to include again.

    print_info(<str>)                        Print string in MTX Framework info style
